Explain the output of this C program. Why the wrong value is being displayed in the output?
The issue with code is that the value is defined as an integer which can only store 4-bits of data.
The value is larger than 4-bits.
This Issue can can be resolved by initializing it as a long integer,in  the following way;

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
long testInteger=3000000000;
printf("Number is %ld",testInteger);
return 0;
}
