Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). 
If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.
1)	Ask for a number ‘a’
2)	Ask for another number ‘b’
3)	To check divisor (a mod b)
4)	If Reminder is zero
5)	Print ‘a’ is a divisor of ‘b’
6)	Check if ‘a’ is even
    If a mod 2 ==0
Print ‘a’ is even
Else Print ‘a’ is odd
End
